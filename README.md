Manage your Migration to Google Tag Manager

Google Tag Manager is a firm favourite for us at SearchStar and we will always recommend it to clients looking for a way to manage their website tracking scripts. However, switching to a tag management system can be a little daunting. A big consideration during any migration is how we ensure that there is only ever one Google Analytics tag running at a time. Multiple tags mean a reduced bounce rate, higher pageviews and therefore higher pages per sessions. On the flip side, no Google Analytics tags running at all results in loss of data. Put simply, it messes up the Analytics. So we set out to find a solution.
